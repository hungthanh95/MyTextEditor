# MyTextEditor
This is my text editor project on Hyperskill.

**About**
Looks like you like challenges! This project, however, is not too tricky if you’re feeling like an advanced learner. 
A text editor you’re going to write allows to search for specific files and open them. Check out the prerequisites, and if you’re ready, let’s roll!

**Learning outcomes**
Apart from applying your basic knowledge about loops, strings, methods, classes and other topics, you will get a grasp of SWING, a widget library for GUI (graphical user interface).
