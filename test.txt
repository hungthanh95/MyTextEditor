In this stage, you will improve the usability of your text editor.

The first thing to point out is that the "Save" and "Load"
buttons take up a lot of space on the screen. You can't add a
lot of buttons to the top bar when they contain text.
This problem can be solved using icons instead of text.
The constructor of JButton can take an ImageIcon instead of text.
You should replace the buttons "Load" and "Save" with corresponding icons.
You can download the icons from the internet.

It is also impractical to restrict users to load (open) a file from only one directory — the project folder.
The Swing library has a useful component for navigating your filesystem — JFileChooser.
So, when the user clicks on the "Open" button (the button that previously was named "Load") you should open a
file manager using JFileChooser and let the user choose the file he wants to open.
Then, the contents of this file should be visible in the text editor. You can use this link to see how to use JFileChooser.
